📈 Stock Price Predictor API

A machine learning-powered API built with FastAPI to forecast stock prices. This project uses a Linear Regression model trained on historical data to predict the closing price for the next day and the next week.

A brief demonstration of the web interface.
✨ Features

    Frontend Interface: Simple and clean UI built with HTML & Tailwind CSS.

    Next-Day Prediction: Get an instant forecast for the next trading day's closing price.

    Weekly Forecast: Perform a recursive forecast to predict prices for the next 5 days.

    Automated Data Handling: The API automatically uses the latest data from the dataset, no manual input required.

    Ready for Deployment: Built with FastAPI, a modern, high-performance web framework.

🛠️ Tech Stack

    Backend: Python, FastAPI

    Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

    Frontend: HTML, Tailwind CSS

    Server: Uvicorn

🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.
1. Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+

    pip package manager

2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the required Python packages.

# Navigate to your project directory
cd path/to/your/project

# Install the dependencies
pip install "fastapi[all]" scikit-learn pandas joblib

3. Running the Application

Once the installation is complete, you can start the API server using Uvicorn.

uvicorn main_auto:app --reload

The server will start and be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
💡 Usage

After starting the server, open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000.

You will see the web interface where you can:

    Click "Predict Next Day" to get a single price prediction.

    Click "Predict Next Week" to get a 5-day price forecast.

🌐 API Endpoints

The application exposes the following API endpoints:

🧠 Model Details

The prediction model is a Linear Regression model from scikit-learn.

    Features Used: The model is trained on 5 "lagged" features from the previous day: Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume.

    Forecasting Method: For the weekly forecast, the model uses a recursive strategy where the prediction for Day 1 is used as an input to predict Day 2, and so on.

⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes only and should not be used for making real financial decisions. Stock market prediction is inherently complex and uncertain. The predictions generated by this model are not guaranteed to be accurate.
