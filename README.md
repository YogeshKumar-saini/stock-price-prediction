# 📈 Stock Price Prediction App using LSTM & Flask

This project is a web-based application that predicts the **next day's stock closing price** using a deep learning LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model. It utilizes **historical stock market data** fetched via `yfinance` and is deployed via a lightweight Flask web interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📉 Predicts the next day’s stock closing price
- 🔁 Utilizes LSTM Neural Networks for time series forecasting
- 🌐 Simple and interactive web interface built with Flask
- 🔍 Preprocessing with MinMaxScaler for accurate scaling
- 📊 Visualization of historical trends and predicted values
